1, With git:
- Don't push any references (libraries) which can be sync automatically by nuget. This mean that: ONLY push references not from nuget (e.g. Microsoft.CodeAnalysis) and check carefully before push to prevent missing some packages.
- Don't push any changes with file .gitignore unless you was familiar on working with it.
- Don't push any file in .gitignore like *.log, Bin/Debug/, etc. (by defaut, these files will not be staged, unless you modified .gitignore file)
